# Actions for Nautilus Config
A copy of my [Actions for Nautilus](https://github.com/bassmanitram/actions-for-nautilus) config from `~/.local/share/actions-for-nautilus`

No promises that any of it works or is optimally set up!

You will want to use a [JSON formatter](https://duckduckgo.com/json%20formatter) if you want to read it easily without loading it into Actions for Nautilus
